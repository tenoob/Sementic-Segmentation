# Semantic-Segmentation

## Project Goals:

- Develop a U-Net model to segment objects in Satellite images.
- Train the model on a Dubai dataset.
- Track and monitor training experiments using MLflow.
- Compare different model versions using DagsHub.- 
- Deploy the final model as a user-friendly Streamlit app.

## Technical Stack:

- Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow
- Model Architecture: U-Net
- Training Environment: Google Colab
- Experiment Tracking: MLflow
- Model Versioning and Comparison: DagsHub
- Deployment Platform: Streamlit

This project provides a starting point for using U-Net models for image segmentation with experiment tracking, model comparison, and deployment using Streamlit. Feel free to adapt and extend this codebase for your specific image segmentation tasks.
